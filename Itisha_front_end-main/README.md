## About the Project: üìö

This is a react app we are building for an online liquor delivery app. The primary purpose of the app is to offer a smooth and
seamless user experience while ordering liquor online.


## Technologies Used: React ‚öõÔ∏è

We plan to move to react native after testing with plain react



## Setup / Installation: üíª

### Step 1 : Clone this repo to your local machine

For Windows Users:

- Copy the link to this repo - https://github.com/Bobby00/Itisha_front_end.git
- Open up gitbash in your working directory and type in the following command - git clone https://github.com/Bobby00/Itisha_front_end.git
- Switch to your specific branch using the following command e.g - git checkout dyno or git checkout maureen

### Once you are done with the changes assigned to you, follow the following steps to update your progress on github:-
1. git add .
2. git commit -m "Enter something here about the change you've made"
3. git push origin dyno or git push origin maureen

NB - Github may prompt you to use an auth token, but you can easily generate one from your developer settings on github.

That should be enough to copy all the necessary files to your local machine and switch you to your branch where you'll be pushing your updates.

### NOTE : Ensure you have react installed on your PC before proceeding. To download React on windows click the following link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/react-on-windows


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
